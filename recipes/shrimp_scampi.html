    <h3>Ingredient</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Shrimp</li>
        <li>Angel Hair Pasta</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Shallots and garlic</li>
        <li>lemon juice and seasonings</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook the pasta first: Boil the pasta in well-salted water, drain, and hold aside before cooking the shrimp scampi. You'll add the pasta to the hot skillet to warm it before serving. Time your cooking so you're ready to start cooking the shrimp immediately after the pasta is drained; you don't want the pasta to sit for too long.</li>
        <li>Don't overcook the shrimp: It takes just a couple of minutes to cook raw shrimp, and if they cook for too long, shrimp turn tough and rubbery. You'll know the shrimp are close to done when they start to curl into a C shape and turn from translucent gray to opaque pink and white.
